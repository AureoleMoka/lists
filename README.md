Attempt of rewrite of haskell code, in my own way of coding. Educational purpose, completly free of rights.
This must be compiled using gcc with nested functions support.
If you don't want to use gcc for any reason, just unnnest nested functions.
Please e-mail me any suggestion you could have. Thanks
